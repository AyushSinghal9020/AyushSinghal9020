They are designed to be `accessible to beginners`, but they also offer `challenges`/`exercises` that will help you grow your skills. Each mini-course is divided into `several modules`, each of which covers a `specific topic`. The modules are typically `short`/`easy` to follow, and they include `interactive exercises` that allow you to practice what you've learned. At the `end` of each mini-course, you will be able to complete a `project` that demonstrates your mastery of the material. These projects are a great way to `showcase the skills` to potential employers or clients.\n","\n","It becomes very `important`/`profitable` both with `time`/`resources` for the `Kaggle Team` to `predict the Sales` of a `particular course` `before` its `launch` and `major development` which helps them in various after tasks such as \n","\n","* **Optimize Marketing Campaigns** - By knowing `how many people` are `likely` to `purchase a mini-course`. Kaggle can allocate its `marketing budget` more `effectively`. For example, if a `mini-course` is `expected to be very popular`, Kaggle can `invest more in advertising` it. Conversely, if a `mini-course` is `not expected to be very popular`, Kaggle can `save money by investing less` in advertising it.\n","* **Pricing** - Knowing `how many people` are `likely to purchase` a mini-course can help Kaggle `set a price` that is `both profitable and attractive` to buyers. For example, if a `mini-course is expected to be very popular`, Kaggle can `charge a higher price for it`. Conversely, if a `mini-course is not expected to be very popular`, Kaggle can `charge a lower price for it`.\n","* **Improve Course Experience**. By knowing `how many people` are `likely to purchase a mini-course`, Kaggle can `make sure` that the `mini-course` is `meeting the needs` of its users. For example, if a `mini-course is not attracting` as many buyers as expected, Kaggle can `review the content of the mini-course` to see if it can be improved.\n","* **New Opportunities** - By predicting Kaggle Mini-Course sales, Kaggle can `identify new opportunities` for growth. For example, if a `mini-course` is `unexpectedly popular`, Kaggle can consider `creating more` mini-courses on `similar topics`.\n","\n","# 1 | Advisory 💡\n","\n","# 2 | Data
