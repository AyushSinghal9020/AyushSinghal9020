It has also been used to create new forms of art and music. `GPT-0` is a powerful tool that has the potential to change the way we interact with computers\n","\n","Today we will try to build our own `GPT-0` trained on the `Kaggle AI Report 2023`, and see the results\n","\n","# 1 | Data 🚀\n","\n","Lets get our data into working "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"40dfd449","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-06T03:37:14.830719Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-06T03:37:14.830157Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-06T03:37:14.839368Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-06T03:37:14.838588Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.029484,"end_time":"2023-06-06T03:37:14.84099","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-06-06T03:37:14.811506","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/kaggle/input/2023-kaggle-ai-report/sample_submission.csv\n","/kaggle/input/2023-kaggle-ai-report/arxiv_metadata_20230510.json\n","/kaggle/input/2023-kaggle-ai-report/kaggle_writeups_20230510.csv\n"]}],"source":[" import pandas as pd \n","import re\n","\n","import os\n","for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n","    for filename in filenames:\n","        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"95add1bc","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-06T03:37:14.878819Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-06T03:37:14.878147Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-06T03:37:15.185934Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-06T03:37:15.185341Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.328963,"end_time":"2023-06-06T03:37:15.187542","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-06-06T03:37:14.858579","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Competition Launch Date</th>\n","      <th>Title of Competition</th>\n","      <th>Competition URL</th>\n","      <th>Date of Writeup</th>\n","      <th>Title of Writeup</th>\n","      <th>Writeup</th>\n","      <th>Writeup URL</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>08/03/2010 00:00:00</td>\n","      <td>Chess ratings - Elo versus the Rest of the World</td>\n","      <td>https://www.kaggle.com/c/2447</td>\n","      <td>11/18/2010 00:06:46</td>\n","      <td>Released: my Source Code and Analysis</td>\n","      <td>&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun with this competition an...</td>\n","      <td>https://www.kaggle.com/c/2447/discussion/185</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>08/03/2010 00:00:00</td>\n","      <td>Chess ratings - Elo versus the Rest of the World</td>\n","      <td>https://www.kaggle.com/c/2447</td>\n","      <td>11/20/2010 04:38:53</td>\n","      <td>6th place(UriB) by Uri Blass</td>\n","      <td>&lt;P&gt;I calculated rating for every player in mon...</td>\n","      <td>https://www.kaggle.com/c/2447/discussion/192</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>08/03/2010 00:00:00</td>\n","      <td>Chess ratings - Elo versus the Rest of the World</td>\n","      <td>https://www.kaggle.com/c/2447</td>\n","      <td>11/23/2010 10:38:23</td>\n","      <td>7th place - littlefish</td>\n","      <td>I'm a little surprised I ended up in the top-1...</td>\n","      <td>https://www.kaggle.com/c/2447/discussion/194</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>08/03/2010 00:00:00</td>\n","      <td>Chess ratings - Elo versus the Rest of the World</td>\n","      <td>https://www.kaggle.com/c/2447</td>\n","      <td>11/20/2010 11:27:17</td>\n","      <td>3rd place: Chessmetrics - Variant</td>\n","      <td>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=\"post_text_content_1230\"&gt;&lt;div dir=...</td>\n","      <td>https://www.kaggle.com/c/2447/discussion/193</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>08/03/2010 00:00:00</td>\n","      <td>Chess ratings - Elo versus the Rest of the World</td>\n","      <td>https://www.kaggle.com/c/2447</td>\n","      <td>11/18/2010 02:44:10</td>\n","      <td>2nd place: TrueSkill Through Time</td>\n","      <td>Wow, this is a surprise!
