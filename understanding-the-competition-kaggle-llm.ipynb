The competition is scored using the `average precision` at `cutoff k metric`, where $k$ is the `number of predictions` made for each question.\n","\n","An estimations shays that the `largest models` run on `Kaggle` are around $10$ $Billion$ $Parameters$, whereas `gpt3.5 clocks` in at $175$ $Billion$ $Parameters$. If a `question-answering model can ace` a test written by a `question-writing model` more than $10$ `times its size`, this would be a genuinely `interesting result`; on the `other hand` if a `larger model can effectively` `stump a smaller one`, this has `compelling implications` on the `ability of LLMs` to benchmark and test themselves.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"07461fc9","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.009768,"end_time":"2023-07-13T03:29:57.017112","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-13T03:29:57.007344","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# <p style=\"font-family:JetBrains Mono; font-weight:bold; letter-spacing: 2px; color:#0000FF; font-size:140%; text-align:left;padding: 0px; border-bottom: 3px solid #0000FF\">1 | Advisory üí° </p>\n","\n","<div style=\"border-radius:10px; border:#92DFF3 solid; padding: 15px; background-color: #92DFF#; font-size:100%; text-align:left\">\n","\n","* This is a $Multi-Label$ $Classification$ $Problem$\n","* The evaluation will not be done for $1$ value but rather than multiple values.
