The `Goal` of the competition is to help `researchers better understand` the `ability of LLMs` to test themselves, and the `potential of LLMs` that can be run in resource-constrained environments.\n","\n","The `dataset` for the competition was generated by giving `gpt3.5 snippets` of text on a range of `scientific topics pulled` from `Wikipedia`, and asking it to `write a multiple choice question` (with a known answer), then `filtering out easy questions`.\n","\n","`Participants` in the competition are asked to `develop an LLM` that can `answer the questions` in the dataset `as accurately as possible`. The competition is scored using the `average precision` at `cutoff k metric`, where $k$ is the `number of predictions` made for each question.\n","\n","An estimations shays that the `largest models` run on `Kaggle` are around $10$ $Billion$ $Parameters$, whereas `gpt3.5 clocks` in at $175$ $Billion$ $Parameters$. If a `question-answering model can ace` a test written by a `question-writing model` more than $10$ `times its size`, this would be a genuinely `interesting result`; on the `other hand` if a `larger model can effectively` `stump a smaller one`, this has `compelling implications` on the `ability of LLMs` to benchmark and test themselves.\n","    \n","Thanks to **[Radek

It is a `reimplementation` of $BERT$ ($Bidirectional$ $Encoder$ $Representations$ from $Transformers$) with some `modifications` to the key `hyperparameters` and `minor embedding tweaks`. These modifications led to `significant performance gains` on a number of NLP tasks. $RoBERTa$ is based on the `transformer architecture`, which is a `Neural Network Architecture` that is particularly well-suited for NLP tasks. The transformer architecture uses `self-attention` to learn `long-range dependencies` between words in a sentence. This allows $RoBERTa$ to learn more `contextual representations` of words, which is important for many NLP tasks.\n","\n","$RoBERTa$ is trained on a `massive dataset` of text and code. The dataset consists of `books`/`articles`/`code`. The dataset is `preprocessed` using `Byte-Level` `BPE` `(Byte Pair Encoding)`, which is a technique for tokenizing text into smaller units.\n","\n","$RoBERTa$ is trained using a `Masked Language Modeling` ($MLM$) objective. In the MLM objective, some of the words in a `sentence are masked`, and the model is then trained to `predict the masked words`. This helps the model to `learn the contextual representations` of words."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"id":"459b9abb","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-23T09:25:51.832139Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-23T09:25:51.831487Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-23T09:26:08.696483Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-23T09:26:08.695408Z"},"id":"g__HqRWmGO1C","outputId":"e30d98c6-f63d-4b07-de3d-b0d9ea17b24f","papermill":{"duration":16.88576,"end_time":"2023-07-23T09:26:08.699325","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-23T09:25:51.813565","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"ed3e6adfb6ff4d468cbc90b9f927b3ec","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading (…)lve/main/config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/481 [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"2e4aefbd947e402ab053d14b3c9f4c11","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading (…)olve/main/vocab.json:   0%|          | 0.00/899k [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"3574bae02f784c86b007400786a1a9f4","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading (…)olve/main/merges.txt:   0%|          | 0.00/456k [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"2524ea12b8b547a5a8ad99d6aba350c2","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading (…)/main/tokenizer.json:   0%|          | 0.00/1.36M [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/scipy/__init__.py:146: UserWarning: A NumPy version >=1.16.5 and <1.23.0 is required for this version of SciPy (detected version 1.23.5\n","  warnings.warn(f\"A NumPy version >={np_minversion} and <{np_maxversion}\"\n","/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/__init__.py:98: UserWarning: unable to load libtensorflow_io_plugins.so: unable to open file: libtensorflow_io_plugins.so, from paths: ['/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/libtensorflow_io_plugins.so']\n","caused by: ['/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/libtensorflow_io_plugins.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3tsl6StatusC1EN10tensorflow5error4CodeESt17basic_string_viewIcSt11char_traitsIcEENS_14SourceLocationE']\n","  warnings.warn(f\"unable to load libtensorflow_io_plugins.so: {e}\")\n","/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/__init__.py:104: UserWarning: file system plugins are not loaded: unable to open file: libtensorflow_io.so, from paths: ['/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/libtensorflow_io.so']\n","caused by: ['/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/libtensorflow_io.so: undefined symbol: _ZTVN10tensorflow13GcsFileSystemE']\n","  warnings.warn(f\"file system plugins are not loaded: {e}\")\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"97ed81f924384d9baa69097a4b87f2b1","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading model.safetensors:   0%|          | 0.00/499M [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Some weights of the model checkpoint at roberta-base were not used when initializing RobertaModel: ['lm_head.layer_norm.weight', 'lm_head.bias', 'lm_head.dense.weight', 'lm_head.layer_norm.bias', 'lm_head.dense.bias']\n","- This IS expected if you are initializing RobertaModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).\n","- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing RobertaModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).\n","Some weights of RobertaModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at roberta-base and are newly initialized: ['roberta.pooler.dense.weight', 'roberta.pooler.dense.bias']\n","You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.\n"]}],"source":["tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"roberta-base\")\n","model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"roberta-base\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"431b2a48","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.017732,"end_time":"2023-07-23T09:26:08.736493","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-23T09:26:08.718761","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<div style=\"border-radius:10px;
