Or in other words. How can we make a `digital system understand this text` \n","    \n","We all know that there $26$, unique alphabets in the `English Language`. Lets assume we are `case-sensetive` and treat `small` and `capital` characters differently, making our known charachters to be $52$, adding special characrers like `. , , , # , {}` and more. Lets assume we reach $70$ characters. \n","    \n","So to crack the problem we had, we map each `distinct character` with a `unique number`. Like for `A` it is $1$, for `B` it is $2$, for `a` to be $27$, and many more. So we kind of mapped our `peice of information` in `numbers`. \n","    \n","In basic terminologies, the \n","\n","|Simple Meaning|Complex Terminology |\n","|---|---|\n","|Universal Set of whole Data|Corpus|\n","|Set of Distinct elements|Vocablury\n","    \n","What we just did was a simple technique called $Bag$ $Of$ $Words$. In this we map each character to a predefined number. One thing to notice here is **Bag of Words do not consider any context**. Bag of words will concider `r` in `racist` and `racer` the same. Just try to remeber this information\n","    \n","Okay so I got an fantastic Idea!!!.\n","\n","Okay so we know that when we `combine characters`, we get `words`. This is called `English Language`. So if we combine the characters `S`/`h`/`r`/`e`/`k`. We will get the word `Shrek`. So the way we know that how many distinct characters are there the `English Language`, what if we somehow get the information of all the distinct `Words` in the `English Language`. Our corpus will increase massively, and so will our size of the `vocublray`. But lets just assume a text (Song **[Choo Lo - The Local Train](https://youtu.be/sFMRqxCexDk)** with English Lyrics)\n","    \n","```\n","I am still standing here today,\n","With hope in my heart.\n","How is this freedom?\n","How is this thirst of the heart?\n","Touch me, whoever you are,\n","I will lose myself day and night.\n","```\n","    \n","Just think a list of numbers representing the `unique characters`/vs, a list of numbers represnting `unique words`. The second list will sure be a smaller one. A smaller list representing the same amount of information will be surely much easier to interpret or apply any mathematical transnformation. The same concept is applied in the **[Sentence Piece by Google](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece)**\n","    \n","But there is a problem with these. The do not retain the contextual meaning of the sentence. Lets assume we have $2$ Sentences like \n","    \n","```\n","Sentence_1 = \"Osama Bin Laden had arms\"\n","Sentence_2 = \"I cut Osama Bin Laden arms\"\n","```\n","Both the sentence contains the word `arms`, but have a very different meaning in both of the Sentence. At first it is in the context of `Weapons` and in other it is in the context of `Hand`. This type of problem is not solved here. \n","    \n","Thats why we use `Neural Networks` to solve this issue. We use different technique like \n","* $Sementic$ $Prediction$\n","* $Next$ $Sentence$ $Prediction$\n","* $Question$ $Answering$\n","\n","to make an Vector Represnetation of Words.\n","    \n","**Wait Wait Wait$!!!$** At `First` we were converting `Words to Numbers`. So now why we are using the `complex word` `Vectors`$...?$ \n","\n","The reason is at `First` we were only `converting words` to **a single number**, but now we are `converting one word` to a `list of numbers`. These numbers try to represent `every possible context` of the word in a corpus. The technique that first used a `Neural Network` is called `Word 2 Vec`. which became very popular. \n","    \n","One thing to notice is that.\n","    \n","* When we are seperating different distinct characters according to the vocablury, we call that `Tokenization`\n","* When we are converting these tokens into numbers, we call that `Embedments`. \n","    \n","Just some wierd word to make us think that $NLP$ is `difficult`.\n","    \n","## $2.2$ $|$ $Transformers$\n","    \n","So `Word 2 Vec` was introduced by `Google` in $2013$ and till then, we have applied different concepts to overcome various difficulties, which include\n","    \n","* $Small$ $Batch$ $Size$\n","* $Small$ $Window$ $Size$\n","* $Small$ $Context$ $Size$\n","* $Large$ $Training$ $Time$\n","* $Less$ $Accuracy$\n","    \n","We introduced different techniques to handle this like $LSTMs$/$GRUs$ and much more, which had their own `cons and pros`.

It is based on the $BERT$ $Model$, but it makes a number of modifications to the pretraining procedure that improve its performance.\n","\n","One of the key differences between $RoBERTa$ and $BERT$ is that $RoBERTa$ uses a `larger batch size` and a `higher learning rate` during pretraining. This allows $RoBERTa$ to learn `more effectively` from the training data. Additionally, $RoBERTa$ removes the `next sentence prediction task` from the pretraining procedure.
