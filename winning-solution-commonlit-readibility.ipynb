Or in other words. How can we make a `digital system understand this text` \n","    \n","We all know that there $26$, unique alphabets in the `English Language`. Lets assume we are `case-sensetive` and treat `small` and `capital` characters differently, making our known charachters to be $52$, adding special characrers like `. , , , # , {}` and more. Lets assume we reach $70$ characters. \n","    \n","So to crack the problem we had, we map each `distinct character` with a `unique number`. Like for `A` it is $1$, for `B` it is $2$, for `a` to be $27$, and many more. So we kind of mapped our `peice of information` in `numbers`. \n","    \n","In basic terminologies, the \n","\n","|Simple Meaning|Complex Terminology |\n","|---|---|\n","|Universal Set of whole Data|Corpus|\n","|Set of Distinct elements|Vocablury\n","    \n","What we just did was a simple technique called $Bag$ $Of$ $Words$. In this we map each character to a predefined number. One thing to notice here is **Bag of Words do not consider any context**. Bag of words will concider `r` in `racist` and `racer` the same. Just try to remeber this information\n","    \n","Okay so I got an fantastic Idea!!!.\n","\n","Okay so we know that when we `combine characters`, we get `words`. This is called `English Language`. So if we combine the characters `S`/`h`/`r`/`e`/`k`. We will get the word `Shrek`. So the way we know that how many distinct characters are there the `English Language`, what if we somehow get the information of all the distinct `Words` in the `English Language`. Our corpus will increase massively, and so will our size of the `vocublray`. But lets just assume a text (Song **[Choo Lo - The Local Train](https://youtu.be/sFMRqxCexDk)** with English Lyrics)\n","    \n","```\n","I am still standing here today,\n","With hope in my heart.\n","How is this freedom?\n","How is this thirst of the heart?\n","Touch me, whoever you are,\n","I will lose myself day and night.\n","```\n","    \n","Just think a list of numbers representing the `unique characters`/vs, a list of numbers represnting `unique words`. The second list will sure be a smaller one. A smaller list representing the same amount of information will be surely much easier to interpret or apply any mathematical transnformation. The same concept is applied in the **[Sentence Piece by Google](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece)**\n","    \n","But there is a problem with these. The do not retain the contextual meaning of the sentence. Lets assume we have $2$ Sentences like \n","    \n","```\n","Sentence_1 = \"Osama Bin Laden had arms\"\n","Sentence_2 = \"I cut Osama Bin Laden arms\"\n","```\n","Both the sentence contains the word `arms`, but have a very different meaning in both of the Sentence. At first it is in the context of `Weapons` and in other it is in the context of `Hand`. This type of problem is not solved here. \n","    \n","Thats why we use `Neural Networks` to solve this issue. We use different technique like \n","* $Sementic$ $Prediction$\n","* $Next$ $Sentence$ $Prediction$\n","* $Question$ $Answering$\n","\n","to make an Vector Represnetation of Words.\n","    \n","**Wait Wait Wait$!!!$** At `First` we were converting `Words to Numbers`. So now why we are using the `complex word` `Vectors`$...?$ \n","\n","The reason is at `First` we were only `converting words` to **a single number**, but now we are `converting one word` to a `list of numbers`. These numbers try to represent `every possible context` of the word in a corpus. The technique that first used a `Neural Network` is called `Word 2 Vec`. which became very popular. \n","    \n","One thing to notice is that.\n","    \n","* When we are seperating different distinct characters according to the vocablury, we call that `Tokenization`\n","* When we are converting these tokens into numbers, we call that `Embedments`. \n","    \n","Just some wierd word to make us think that $NLP$ is `difficult`.\n","    \n","## $2.2$ $|$ $Transformers$\n","    \n","So `Word 2 Vec` was introduced by `Google` in $2013$ and till then, we have applied different concepts to overcome various difficulties, which include\n","    \n","* $Small$ $Batch$ $Size$\n","* $Small$ $Window$ $Size$\n","* $Small$ $Context$ $Size$\n","* $Large$ $Training$ $Time$\n","* $Less$ $Accuracy$\n","    \n","We introduced different techniques to handle this like $LSTMs$/$GRUs$ and much more, which had their own `cons and pros`.

It is also uncased, which means that it does not make a difference between the words \"english\" and \"English\". $Albert$ $XX$ $Large$ $v2$ can be used for a variety of $Natural$ $Language$ $Processing$ $(NLP)$ tasks, including:\n","* $Question$ $Answering$\n","* $Machine$ $Translation$\n","* $Text$ $Summarization$\n","* $Text$ $Classification$\n","* $Natural$ $Language$ $Inference$"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":24,"id":"818fcf0e","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-17T04:04:05.596991Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-17T04:04:05.595969Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-17T04:04:20.903713Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-17T04:04:20.902784Z"},"papermill":{"duration":15.327274,"end_time":"2023-07-17T04:04:20.906156","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-17T04:04:05.578882","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"585d5a7594a54e4084a8134a6ac71b1c","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading (…)lve/main/config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/684 [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/__init__.py:98: UserWarning: unable to load libtensorflow_io_plugins.so: unable to open file: libtensorflow_io_plugins.so, from paths: ['/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/libtensorflow_io_plugins.so']\n","caused by: ['/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/libtensorflow_io_plugins.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3tsl6StatusC1EN10tensorflow5error4CodeESt17basic_string_viewIcSt11char_traitsIcEENS_14SourceLocationE']\n","  warnings.warn(f\"unable to load libtensorflow_io_plugins.so: {e}\")\n","/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/__init__.py:104: UserWarning: file system plugins are not loaded: unable to open file: libtensorflow_io.so, from paths: ['/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/libtensorflow_io.so']\n","caused by: ['/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tensorflow_io/python/ops/libtensorflow_io.so: undefined symbol: _ZTVN10tensorflow13GcsFileSystemE']\n","  warnings.warn(f\"file system plugins are not loaded: {e}\")\n"]},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"56beca4e5818470cb1481929f1db3b5b","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading model.safetensors:   0%|          | 0.00/47.4M [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Some weights of the model checkpoint at albert-base-v2 were not used when initializing AlbertForSequenceClassification: ['predictions.bias', 'predictions.decoder.bias', 'predictions.dense.weight', 'predictions.LayerNorm.weight', 'predictions.dense.bias', 'predictions.LayerNorm.bias']\n","- This IS expected if you are initializing AlbertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).\n","- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing AlbertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).\n","Some weights of AlbertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at albert-base-v2 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']\n","You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.\n"]}],"source":["albert_xx_large_v2_hyperparams = {\n","    \"bs\" : 3 ,\n","    \"alpha\" : 9e-6 , \n","    'weight_decay': 0.01, \n","    'epochs': 5,\n","    'hidden_dropout': 0.07,\n","    'attention_probs_dropout': 0.1 \n","#     'logging_steps': 60\n","}\n","\n","config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(\"albert-base-v2\", num_labels = 1,\n","                                    hidden_dropout_prob = albert_xx_large_v2_hyperparams['hidden_dropout'],\n","                                    attention_probs_dropout_prob = albert_xx_large_v2_hyperparams['attention_probs_dropout'])\n","\n","model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\"albert-base-v2\", num_labels = 1)\n","optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters() , lr  = albert_xx_large_v2_hyperparams['alpha'])\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c50d5c1a","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.016006,"end_time":"2023-07-17T04:04:20.937466","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-17T04:04:20.92146","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# <p style=\"font-family:JetBrains Mono;
