Or in other words. How can we make a `digital system understand this text` \n","    \n","We all know that there $26$, unique alphabets in the `English Language`. Lets assume we are `case-sensetive` and treat `small` and `capital` characters differently, making our known charachters to be $52$, adding special characrers like `. , , , # , {}` and more. Lets assume we reach $70$ characters. \n","    \n","So to crack the problem we had, we map each `distinct character` with a `unique number`. Like for `A` it is $1$, for `B` it is $2$, for `a` to be $27$, and many more. So we kind of mapped our `peice of information` in `numbers`. \n","    \n","In basic terminologies, the \n","\n","|Simple Meaning|Complex Terminology |\n","|---|---|\n","|Universal Set of whole Data|Corpus|\n","|Set of Distinct elements|Vocablury\n","    \n","What we just did was a simple technique called $Bag$ $Of$ $Words$. In this we map each character to a predefined number. One thing to notice here is **Bag of Words do not consider any context**. Bag of words will concider `r` in `racist` and `racer` the same. Just try to remeber this information\n","    \n","Okay so I got an fantastic Idea!!!.\n","\n","Okay so we know that when we `combine characters`, we get `words`. This is called `English Language`. So if we combine the characters `S`/`h`/`r`/`e`/`k`. We will get the word `Shrek`. So the way we know that how many distinct characters are there the `English Language`, what if we somehow get the information of all the distinct `Words` in the `English Language`. Our corpus will increase massively, and so will our size of the `vocublray`. But lets just assume a text (Song **[Choo Lo - The Local Train](https://youtu.be/sFMRqxCexDk)** with English Lyrics)\n","    \n","```\n","I am still standing here today,\n","With hope in my heart.\n","How is this freedom?\n","How is this thirst of the heart?\n","Touch me, whoever you are,\n","I will lose myself day and night.\n","```\n","    \n","Just think a list of numbers representing the `unique characters`/vs, a list of numbers represnting `unique words`. The second list will sure be a smaller one. A smaller list representing the same amount of information will be surely much easier to interpret or apply any mathematical transnformation. The same concept is applied in the **[Sentence Piece by Google](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece)**\n","    \n","But there is a problem with these. The do not retain the contextual meaning of the sentence. Lets assume we have $2$ Sentences like \n","    \n","```\n","Sentence_1 = \"Osama Bin Laden had arms\"\n","Sentence_2 = \"I cut Osama Bin Laden arms\"\n","```\n","Both the sentence contains the word `arms`, but have a very different meaning in both of the Sentence. At first it is in the context of `Weapons` and in other it is in the context of `Hand`. This type of problem is not solved here. \n","    \n","Thats why we use `Neural Networks` to solve this issue. We use different technique like \n","* $Sementic$ $Prediction$\n","* $Next$ $Sentence$ $Prediction$\n","* $Question$ $Answering$\n","\n","to make an Vector Represnetation of Words.\n","    \n","**Wait Wait Wait$!!!$** At `First` we were converting `Words to Numbers`. So now why we are using the `complex word` `Vectors`$...?$ \n","\n","The reason is at `First` we were only `converting words` to **a single number**, but now we are `converting one word` to a `list of numbers`. These numbers try to represent `every possible context` of the word in a corpus. The technique that first used a `Neural Network` is called `Word 2 Vec`. which became very popular. \n","    \n","One thing to notice is that.\n","    \n","* When we are seperating different distinct characters according to the vocablury, we call that `Tokenization`\n","* When we are converting these tokens into numbers, we call that `Embedments`. \n","    \n","Just some wierd word to make us think that $NLP$ is `difficult`.\n","    \n","## $2.2$ $|$ $Transformers$\n","    \n","So `Word 2 Vec` was introduced by `Google` in $2013$ and till then, we have applied different concepts to overcome various difficulties, which include\n","    \n","* $Small$ $Batch$ $Size$\n","* $Small$ $Window$ $Size$\n","* $Small$ $Context$ $Size$\n","* $Large$ $Training$ $Time$\n","* $Less$ $Accuracy$\n","    \n","We introduced different techniques to handle this like $LSTMs$/$GRUs$ and much more, which had their own `cons and pros`.

It is based on the $BERT$ $Model$, but it makes a number of modifications to the pretraining procedure that improve its performance.\n","\n","One of the key differences between $RoBERTa$ and $BERT$ is that $RoBERTa$ uses a `larger batch size` and a `higher learning rate` during pretraining. This allows $RoBERTa$ to learn `more effectively` from the training data. Additionally, $RoBERTa$ removes the `next sentence prediction task` from the pretraining procedure. This task was originally used in BERT to help the model learn the relationship between sentences, but $RoBERTa$ found that it was `not necessary` for `good performance`.\n","\n","$RoBERTa$ has been shown to outperform $BERT$ on a number of $Natural$ $Language$ $Processing$ $Tasks$, including \n","* $Question$ $Answering$\n","* $Natural$ $Language$ $Inference$\n","* $Text$ $Summarization$\n","\n","<img src = \"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352642553/figure/fig2/AS:1037416861282304@1624350862022/The-RoBERTa-model-architecture.ppm\" width = 400>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"id":"76049fdc","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-21T15:46:15.206843Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-21T15:46:15.206141Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-21T15:46:16.481058Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-21T15:46:16.47991Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.303397,"end_time":"2023-07-21T15:46:16.483635","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-21T15:46:15.180238","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"41da4bfc11a7450d9cbbb6565110c14b","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading (…)olve/main/vocab.json:   0%|          | 0.00/899k [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"1cb8dd01edf24d35af899e51c02ddc9f","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading (…)olve/main/merges.txt:   0%|          | 0.00/456k [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"04251dea396c4367a0976287f21e14ab","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading (…)lve/main/config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/481 [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"text/plain":["RobertaTokenizer(name_or_path='roberta-base', vocab_size=50265, model_max_length=512, is_fast=False, padding_side='right', truncation_side='right', special_tokens={'bos_token': AddedToken(\"<s>\", rstrip=False, lstrip=False, single_word=False, normalized=True), 'eos_token': AddedToken(\"</s>\", rstrip=False, lstrip=False, single_word=False, normalized=True), 'unk_token': AddedToken(\"<unk>\", rstrip=False, lstrip=False, single_word=False, normalized=True), 'sep_token': AddedToken(\"</s>\", rstrip=False, lstrip=False, single_word=False, normalized=True), 'pad_token': AddedToken(\"<pad>\", rstrip=False, lstrip=False, single_word=False, normalized=True), 'cls_token': AddedToken(\"<s>\", rstrip=False, lstrip=False, single_word=False, normalized=True), 'mask_token': AddedToken(\"<mask>\", rstrip=False, lstrip=True, single_word=False, normalized=True)}, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True)"]},"execution_count":18,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"roberta-base\")\n","tokenizer"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0114a08a","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.024395,"end_time":"2023-07-21T15:46:16.533387","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-21T15:46:16.508992","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<div style=\"border-radius:10px; border:#FF0000 solid; padding: 15px; background-color: #F3f9ed; font-size:100%; text-align:left\">\n","\n","If we send a sample text like \n","```\n","Your dreams are shining in the darkness.
