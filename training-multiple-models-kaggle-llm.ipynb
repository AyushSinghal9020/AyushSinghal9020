The `Goal` of the competition is to help `researchers better understand` the `ability of LLMs` to test themselves, and the `potential of LLMs` that can be run in resource-constrained environments.\n","\n","The `dataset` for the competition was generated by giving `gpt3.5 snippets` of text on a range of `scientific topics pulled` from `Wikipedia`, and asking it to `write a multiple choice question` (with a known answer), then `filtering out easy questions`.\n","\n","`Participants` in the competition are asked to `develop an LLM` that can `answer the questions` in the dataset `as accurately as possible`. The competition is scored using the `average precision` at `cutoff k metric`, where $k$ is the `number of predictions` made for each question.\n","\n","An estimations shays that the `largest models` run on `Kaggle` are around $10$ $Billion$ $Parameters$, whereas `gpt3.5 clocks` in at $175$ $Billion$ $Parameters$. If a `question-answering model can ace` a test written by a `question-writing model` more than $10$ `times its size`, this would be a genuinely `interesting result`; on the `other hand` if a `larger model can effectively` `stump a smaller one`, this has `compelling implications` on the `ability of LLMs` to benchmark and test themselves.\n","    \n","Thanks to **[Radek

It is a `reimplementation` of $BERT$ ($Bidirectional$ $Encoder$ $Representations$ from $Transformers$) with some `modifications` to the key `hyperparameters` and `minor embedding tweaks`. These modifications led to `significant performance gains` on a number of NLP tasks. $RoBERTa$ is based on the `transformer architecture`, which is a `Neural Network Architecture` that is particularly well-suited for NLP tasks. The transformer architecture uses `self-attention` to learn `long-range dependencies` between words in a sentence. This allows $RoBERTa$ to learn more `contextual representations` of words, which is important for many NLP tasks.\n","\n","$RoBERTa$ is trained on a `massive dataset` of text and code. The dataset consists of `books`/`articles`/`code`. The dataset is `preprocessed` using `Byte-Level` `BPE` `(Byte Pair Encoding)`, which is a technique for tokenizing text into smaller units.\n","\n","$RoBERTa$ is trained using a `Masked Language Modeling` ($MLM$) objective. In the MLM objective, some of the words in a `sentence are masked`, and the model is then trained to `predict the masked words`.
